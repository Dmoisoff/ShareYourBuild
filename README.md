Welcome to the ShareYourBuild wiki!

Share Your Build is a site for DIY enthusiasts to post their creations to share with the web. Users can create projects with detailed instructions with a picture or a video. Visitors can search Share Your Build for projects, favorite any builds you like, and leave comments.

**Features**
* Authentication
  * A user can sign in or sign up from any page via the links on the header. Trying to create a build will redirect the user to the sign in page.
  * The login credentials are verified on the backend and returns any relevant data to the user.
* Created a robust project form that allows users to create and update projects.
  * The form uses a system that allows parent component and multiple child components to share information between them.
  * Using the information sharing I was able to create a system of frontend validations to make sure the form is filled out properly.
* Users can leave comments on builds that they enjoy.
